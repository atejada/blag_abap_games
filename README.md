Games in ABAP

These are a small collection of games that I developed using ABAP back in 2010...been a while...

To install the games, you just need to go to SE38, create them and paste the source code...

For the Master Mind game, you need to upload the 0100 file to the Screen Painter SE51.

Sorry, I don't have access to an SAP system anymore, so no screenshots.
